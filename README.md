#***ðŸ§  Alzheimer MRI Classification (CNN)***

# What the project does?

This project focuses on categorizing Alzheimerâ€™s disease MRI scans into various stages of progression, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe, or Non-Demented, through the application of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The training process utilizes the Augmented Alzheimer MRI Dataset, with the option to implement Transfer Learning to enhance accuracy and minimize training duration.

# Why the project is useful?

Detecting Alzheimerâ€™s disease at an early stage significantly helps doctors and researchers deliver timely treatment and monitor the progression of the condition. This project highlights how deep learning technology can streamline MRI analysis, offering greater speed and accuracy compared to conventional manual techniques.
